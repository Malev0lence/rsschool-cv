# My name is Alexey Pavlov and I want to become FrontEnd developer

## About me.

I’ve always been interested in programming, especially in web development. When I was about 14 years old I created my first website (It was ugly as hell :)). Then I decided that web development is not for me and gave it up for some years. Later at university I decided to try again learned some basic HTML5, CSS, vanilla JS, but when it was time to write my diploma I had to postpound my web education.

I consider myself as fast learning, friendly and communicative person with great willing to be a front-end developer.
